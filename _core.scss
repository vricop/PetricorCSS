// TODO:
// [-] Generate color generators for: border, text and background
// [-] Implement enabling/disabling for modules
// [-] Remove state arguments/parameters for hover and other features inside
//     mixins, leave only $breakpoints for responsive
// [x] Add flex alignments
// [ ] Improve comments in _paddings.scss (look at _margins.scss)
// [ ] Negative margin classes don't have responsive variants at this moment. 
//     Decide whether or not they should be included after some test building 
//     some projects
